  [doc] Documentation touch-up, move from Qualys SVN to github.

2011-02-17 mjp
  [api] Remove #epoch() method, #pid() now returns nil if service is not
  running (formerly returned zero).
  [int] Remove Forwardable delegation, refactor SvDir and StatusBytes
  accordingly.  A skosh more efficient, but also puts method documentation
  in the class that needs it.
  [tst] Update tests for API changes, delegation refactoring and corrupt
  status file handling.
  [doc] update LICENSE, copyright notice, README
  [pkg] remove Echoe dependency, generate gem with vanilla rake tasks
  (Rakefile)

2008-10-13 mjp
  [api] make that ENXIO/EWHATEVER on non-running supervisor.  Raise
  EPROTO specifically on truncated 'status' file.
  [tst] Fixtures::TempSvDir makes bona fide FIFOs, correctly makes
  incremented tempdirs.  ts_control renamed ts_signal, also test non-
  running supervisor (ts_nosupervisor).
  [doc] note Errno:: conventions, use "supervisor" consistently.

2008-10-10 mjp
